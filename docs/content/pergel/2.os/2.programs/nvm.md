# What is Nvm?

Nvm is a version manager for node.js, designed to be installed per-user, and invoked per-shell.

Nvm works on any POSIX-compliant shell (sh, dash, ksh, zsh, bash), in particular on these platforms: unix, macOS, and windows WSL. It supports running on Linux, macOS, WSL, and windows.


## Install Nvm

You can install the Nvm program with [Pergel](/pergel/getting-started).

To make sure that Nvm is installed correctly, run the following command: `nvm --version`
