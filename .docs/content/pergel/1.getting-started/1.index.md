# Introduction

The beginning of every new project in the software world is determined by the steps taken with care and success depends on taking these steps with great care. With this belief, we set out to offer unique and functional solutions in the software world and named our journey "Pergel".

(/pergel/, compass in Turkish)

# Prerequisites

Before installing Pergel on linux or macOS, you must make sure youâ€™ve downloaded all required installation files and elements.

To install Pergel you just need to install curl.

## Install Curl

[Curl](os/programs/curl) comes installed on both Ubuntu (or other Debian-based distributions) and macOS. However, if you need to check if it is installed, you can verify by running `curl --version`.

If you do not have curl installed, you can install it using the following command:

::code-group

```sh [linux]
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl
```

```sh [macOS]
brew install curl

```
::

When finished, curl should be successfully installed. You can verify by running `curl --version` again.

> If homebrew is not installed for macOS, you can install it using the command below:

::code-group

```sh [macOS]
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
