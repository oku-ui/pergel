Pergel is a free and [open-source](https://github.com/oku-ui/pergel) with an MIT license. It is a full stack Nuxt or Nitro application.

We made Pergel to help developers to start a new project quickly. The goal of the Pergel is to deliver all the tools required for a project in a toolbox, complete and up to date.

The Pergel comes out of the toolbox with a CLI, Nuxt, Nitro, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, GraphQL, Docker, Drizzle, RabbitMQ, Redis, PostgreSQL, and more.


## Architecture

We create a connection between the Nuxt or Nitro modules and the CLI. In each project, we set the settings of the packages required in the installation in a 100% free way and give them back to the user in the simplest way to use them. We also provide a simple and easy-to-use CLI for the user to use the packages we have installed.

Each package module is automatically detected by the CLI to load the necessary dependencies into your project's package json. The CLI also automatically detects the settings of the packages you have installed and creates the necessary files for you.

The CLI is also able to detect the settings of the packages you have installed and create the necessary files for you. For example, if you install the GraphQL module, the CLI will automatically detect the settings of the GraphQL module and create the necessary files for you.

Pergel is composed of diffrent [core packages](https://github.com/oku-ui/pergel/tree/main/packages)

- Command line interface: [pergel](https://github.com/oku-ui/pergel/tree/main/packages/cli)
- Nuxt Module: [@pergel/nuxt](https://github.com/oku-ui/pergel/tree/main/packages/nuxt)
- Nitro Module(soon): [@pergel/nitro](https://github.com/oku-ui/pergel/tree/main/packages/nitro)
