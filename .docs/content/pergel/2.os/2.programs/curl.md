## What is Curl?

Curl is a command-line tool and library used for data communication using URLs. Curl supports a wide range of protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SCP, SFTP, LDAP, and many more) and can be used in versatile ways. It's compiled and distributed for many different operating systems.

Using Curl, you can send HTTP requests to web servers, download files, interact with web services, and perform various other tasks. It's a fast and powerful tool, especially when used in the command line.

To use Curl, you can enter the following syntax in the command line:

::code-group

```sh [terminal]
curl [options] [URL...]
```
